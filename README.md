# :running_woman: How to run this project


First, run the development server:

  

```bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

  

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

  

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

  

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
